Hello, my name is Nikita. I'm 38. I'm married. We are currently living in Alanya, Turkey.

My main skills:
- to learn
- to create
- to grow

I experienced in learning, creating and growing all kinds of systems:
software, organizations, working processes, events etc.

I enjoy to solving difficult problems. I like to focus on them, look
at them from different angles, analyze them, build opinions and make
decisions.

At free time I like to cycling, camping, listening music.

You can read [[file:cv.org][my employment history]] if you interested.

I'm writing Clojure now. Only one public [[https://github.com/nekifirus/sac][project]] yet.

Also you can look at my [[https://github.com/nekifirus/.emacs.d][Emacs]] or [[https://github.com/nekifirus/nixos][Nixos]] configs also.
